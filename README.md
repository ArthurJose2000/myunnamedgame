# My unnamed game

It is a prototype game that I developed as part of a selection process to join a game company. The game was developed using the Unity game engine.

The player pilots a spaceship that can navigate within the screen boundaries using either the WASD keys or the arrow keys. Pressing SPACE allows the player to fire projectiles at enemies, which are represented as squares. When an enemy is defeated, thereâ€™s a chance for an item to drop, such as points, a weapon upgrade, or a shield upgrade.

To run the game, import the project into Unity, open the scene named "SampleScene", and press play. The scene is located in the folder "Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity".
